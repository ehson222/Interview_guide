# Interview_guide for FAAMG

## I've personally completed around 160 problems in the past 4 months.  Some topics will take longer to learn than others.
Note that I’m assuming you already know the following topics: Big O Notation, Algorithm Complexity, and Memory Consumption.

### General strategy:
Set a timer for 35 minutes.

I.  Pick a data structure or programming pattern and do at least 10 problems with the instructions below.

II. Spend 20 minutes on design (whiteboard/paper), 10 mins on coding and last 5 minutes with debugging (off by one errors) and test cases (have at least 7 test cases).  Note that before going ahead with your algorithm, make sure to state the space and time complexity.

III. If you are over the 20 minute mark and have some idea where to go, then keep going until timer ends.  If you have no idea after the first 20 minutes, just look at the solution.  Look at the best solution that you understand, not necessarily optimal solution (I’m guessing you are new, some optimal solutions are very lengthy and overly complicated).

IV. If you came to incorrect solution due to a few logical errors in your code, read the last sentence of step 2.  

V. Write down and or remember what made this problem unique, what was the trick to understanding/solving this problem.

VI. ROTE memorization will not pass
