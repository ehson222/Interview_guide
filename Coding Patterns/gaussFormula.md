This formula comes in handy when finding missing number in array with certain constraints and finding the duplicate in array (with certain constraints).  
I'll let you solve problems and try to figure out where to use this formula, it will be an exercise challenge.

```
int gauss1(int n){
return (n * (n + 1) / 2);
}

int gauss2(int n){
return (n * (n - 1) / 2);
}
```
